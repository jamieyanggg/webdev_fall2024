I think wireframing is a great tool when going about designing a website. Planning ahead
and actually drawing a simple layout of your website can actually decrease stress and makes it 
easier to make changes later on. 
Making a wireframe can help get feedback early from your employers or boss and you can make the changes before making something more concrete. Then after making the first prototype you can get more feedback and go on from there.
